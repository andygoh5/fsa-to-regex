# FSA to RegEx Conversion in Haskell
Final project for Computational Linguistics I. The theory for the FSA to RegEx converter is based off of *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* by Michael Sipser.

The main code can be found in [finalproject.hs](finalproject.hs). See the [summary report](Ling%20185A%20Final%20Project%20â€”%20FSA%20to%20RegEx%20Conversion.pdf) for a more detailed explanation.
